Formula Nano is a scientific competition that aims to advance the way we design and test the performance of [molecular machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_machine). In this race, the *cars* are single molecules consisting of a few hundred atoms and the track is a pristine metal surface that is only 100 nm long. The goal is to come up with the best molecular design (nanocar) optimized to diffuse on a particular surface like gold.
