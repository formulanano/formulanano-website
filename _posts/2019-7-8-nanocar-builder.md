We started developing a new nanocar builder and we want this to be the most user friendly molecule editor of the web with an emphasis on building nanocars. This application will allow users to build nanocars (and perhaps other molecular machines in the future) using our website without installing any additional software. The software is currently being developed on GitHub, please feel free to contribute.
